# ChartJS

## What I used?

I used Vanilla JS and ChartJS.

## How I did this project?

I injected data manually in Javascript, and manipulated with ChartJS functions inside script.js. 

## How would I do this project next time?

I would fetch online data and depending on data change, chart will change automatically.

## Images?
